NOTE that Windows service support is currently removed,
in the next minor version it will be reimplemented from scratch.

1. Don't forget to backup current version. 
2. Delete temp directory, it won't be used anymore
3. Copy sitemonitoring.war and delete old sitemonitoring.jar
4. These configuration files must be changed manually: 
      startup.bat
      reset-admin-credentials.bat
   (it should be self-explanatory)
   Note: if you didn't make changes to your configuration files, 
   just simply copy them
