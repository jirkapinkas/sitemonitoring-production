How to upgrade to new version?

Old version location: [sitemon-old]

How to upgrade:
1. Stop application
2. Download newer ZIP file, unzip it's contents to [sitemon-old] and overwrite existing files.
NOTE: if you manually changed some files (for example startup.bat), you must merge their contents manually!!!
3. Remove [sitemon-old]/temp
4. Start application

DONE :-)
